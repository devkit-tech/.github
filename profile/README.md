## Why Devkit exists ?
> As a software engineer, my experience begins into big IT services companies.  
> I was disapointed by the way of thinking of those companies :
> - use young and passionate engineer to maximize profit
> - cheat at customers using false roadmap to maximize bills
> - use buzzing slogan like "human before all" then act as "profit before all"
> - do not give value to employee training desire
> - use teams with more managers than producers
> - misuse technologies and bypass features to minimize costs
> - promote inexperienced engineer as expert and guru
> - use short term view to make decision
> - underestimate documentation
> 
>
> This way of thinking is the nemesis of Devkit.  
> It's a point of failure catalyzer in any kind of project.
>
> Devkit D.N.A are **sanity and common sense** :
> - Documentation is a gift for your future self
> - Not knowing is not a fatality
> - A good team is a team with team spirit
> - A skilled team is a team with backups
> - A balanced team is made of experts **and** rookies
> - Transparency is a door to trust
> - Long term view minimize cost
> - Common sense maximize profit
> - Profit do not always mean money
> - Use open source solutions
> - A **balanced solution** exists to each problem
> - A developer **use** computer **but is not** a computer
> - A manager **has to** unite and guide team
>
> It is why I created Devkit and became freelance engineer.  
> More than a company, it is a proof of concept that common sense lead to success.
